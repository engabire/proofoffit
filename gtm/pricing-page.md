## Explainer — How Pricing Scales

> Pricing indexes to what **you** control—seats, concurrent roles, and verification work.
> As usage grows, volume tiers **lower your marginal unit cost**. Annual commitments lock in
> price protection.

## Unit Glossary

- **Recruiter/Admin seats:** People who manage roles and candidates.
- **Active job slots:** Concurrent roles you keep open.
- **Talent reach units:** Candidate contact/unlock/message credits.
- **Verification credits:** “Proofs” you run per candidate (skills/video/ID checks).

## FAQ

- **Can I change plans anytime?** Yes. Upgrades prorate immediately; downgrades take effect on
  the next billing cycle.
- **How do overages work?** When you exceed included units, we apply transparent per-unit rates
  for that month. You can add a commit or a Scale Pack anytime to lower unit costs.
- **Do you support my ATS?** We support leading ATS platforms. New connectors are added regularly.
- **Do you offer data residency?** Yes. Region packs are available (EU, CA, more on request).
- **Is Proofoffit accessible?** Yes. Accessibility is a core requirement; audits available for
  Enterprise.

## Blue Ocean Positioning Slice

- **Outcome > eyeballs:** We do not charge for views or generic posts. You pay for *proof of fit*—
  verifications and qualified reach—so hiring quality rises as cost per qualified applicant falls.
- **Governance as a fence:** Compliance and control stay in higher tiers, keeping SMB value-rich
  while protecting Enterprise margin.
- **Transparency as leverage:** Calculator, plan cards, and unit tables anchor marginal cost and
  emphasize how scale reduces price per qualified hire.

## Assumptions & Follow-ups

- Usage tiers for Enterprise will be confirmed with Sales Engineering before publishing.
- Pricing example scenarios for calculator tooltips will be drafted with RevOps by 2025-10-17.

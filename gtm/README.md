### One-page brief (fill)
- **Goal:** Launch Impact Access nonprofit pricing + Verification Credit Fund on 2025-10-24 with
  pilot nonprofits migrated, donor underwriting live, and pricing guardrails intact.
- **Audience (ICP/segments):** Workforce development and social impact nonprofits (50–1,000 FTE),
  philanthropic foundations underwriting verification credits, government workforce programs.
- **Positioning:** For nonprofit hiring leaders that need auditable, equitable placements,
  ProofOfFit is the compliance-first hiring OS that prices to verified outcomes because
  ProofLayers™ evidence and donor-backed credits deliver trust and affordability without
  compromising governance.
- **Routes to market:** Direct sales to mid-market/enterprise nonprofits, self-serve PLG funnel for
  N1/N2 tiers, partner referrals via foundation/donor alliances.
- **KPIs:** Primary — Impact Access conversions (nonprofit logos live). Secondary — Verification
  Credit Fund commitments signed. Guardrail — Discount leakage vs. margin floor (script +
  dashboard).
- **Key dates:** Beta wrap 2025-10-17, Pricing lock 2025-10-19, Go/No-Go 2025-10-22, Launch
  2025-10-24, Day 1–7 readout 2025-10-31.
- **Risks (Top 5) + mitigations:** 1) Research calls slip → double-book network + async survey.
  2) Pricing guardrails drift → run daily margin guardrail script and finance check-in. 3) Content
  asset backlog → prioritize homepage hero + demo video and reuse copy from pricing system SSoT.
  4) Compliance review delay → pre-brief Legal on Bridge Mode/EDHP updates, reuse existing ToS
  templates. 5) Donor fund story thin → capture pilot outcomes + IEI snapshots in comms brief.

## Discount Guardrails

| Segment | Plan scope | Discount cap | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMB self-serve | Starter, Growth checkout | 10–15% | Annual prepay only |
| Mid-market (Sales-assisted Growth) | Growth | 0–20% | 12–24 month term, invoicing, or logo/case study rights |
| Enterprise | Enterprise | 0–30% | Multi-year (≥2 yrs), volume commits, security review assets, joint GTM |
| Add-ons | All tiers | 0–10% | Never discount to $0; bundle to unlock |

## Give-to-Get Matrix

| Concession traded | Discount guidance |
|---|---|
| 12–24 month term | +5–12% |
| Annual prepay (net 15) | +5–8% |
| Multi-year price protection with step-up commits | +5–10% |
| Reference call + public logo + case study | +5% |
| Security review assets (questionnaires, pen test) | +3–5% |
| Multi-workspace or region expansion | +5–10% |

## Quote Hygiene

- Quotes expire in 14 days; include quote ID and validity on PDF exports.
- Overage unit rates = committed unit rate × 1.25; push Scale Pack before heavy overage.
- Compliance add-ons never discounted to $0; show standalone list price in proposal.

## Renewal Rhythm

- **120/90/60/30-day** value reviews: usage, time-to-hire, verification pass rates, avoided
  incidents.
- Offer price protection on unit rates for multi-year renewals in exchange for commit step-ups or
  new add-on adoption.

## Expansion Triggers

- In-product nudges at 70/85/95% of commit.
- Promote “Scale Pack”: +1,000 reach units +250 verifications at 10–15% off list plus priority
  support for the period.

## Competitive Posture (Blue Ocean)

- Compete on outcomes, not eyeballs: highlight qualified reach and verified fit as pricing units.
- Governance fences: SSO/SCIM, audit logs, DPAs, and residency live in Growth/Enterprise to
  protect upmarket value.
- TCO clarity: calculator and quotes reveal marginal unit cost and tier drops; incumbents seldom
  expose this.
- Risk reversal: pilot with capped units, roll into annual commit with price protection when
  success metrics land.

## Objection Handlers

- **“Seats are expensive.”** Seats govern collaboration and security. Shift spend to unit commits if
  workload, not roles, is the constraint.
- **“We need predictability.”** Annual pool commit with overage capped at +25% plus Scale Pack
  optionality preserves flexibility.
- **“Compliance is table stakes.”** Compliance has ongoing cost. Packaging it as add-ons keeps base
  price lower while regulated teams fund the coverage.

## Assumptions & Follow-ups

- Floor, target, and walk-away pricing per segment will be finalized with Finance by 2025-10-20.
- Need RevOps sign-off on Scale Pack SKU codes before enabling discount requests in CRM.

## Calculation Logic

```text
seats_overage = max(0, seats - seats_incl)
slots_overage = max(0, slots - slots_incl)
reach_overage_units = max(0, reach_units - reach_incl)
verify_overage_units = max(0, verify_units - verify_incl)

monthly_variable = (seats_overage * seat_add)
                 + (slots_overage * slot_add)
                 + (reach_overage_units * reach_over)
                 + (verify_overage_units * verify_over)

monthly_total = base_monthly + monthly_variable
annualized_core = monthly_total * (12 if billing == "Annual" else 1)

addons_annual = sum(selected_addons)
grand_total = annualized_core + (addons_annual if billing == "Annual"
                                 else addons_annual / 12)
```

## UX Rules

- Real-time updates, highlighting **Projected Monthly Total** and **Marginal Unit Cost**.
- At 70% / 85% / 95% of included units, surface a nudge: “Add a commit to lower unit cost.”
- When variable cost > base × 1.5, recommend the next plan.
- If seats > 20, slots > 50, or verifications > 1,000/mo → show Enterprise contact CTA.
- Provide tooltips defining each unit in one sentence.
- Allow export/share as PDF; include unique quote ID and 14-day validity when generated by
  sales.

## Admin Controls (Internal)

- Editable thresholds, unit prices, and inclusions per plan.
- Region-gated A/B price testing (card variants, unit steps).
- Floor pricing guardrails with warnings for reps.
- Ability to lock Enterprise ranges while surfacing contact flow.

## Logging & Analytics

- Track interaction events: plan switch, billing toggle, add-on selection, PDF export.
- Record submitted estimates in analytics warehouse with quote ID for follow-up.
- Flag scenarios where nudges fire but users do not adjust plan; feed into lifecycle messaging.

## Assumptions & Follow-ups

- Enterprise ranges will be synced with RevOps once floor pricing review completes (target
  2025-10-18).
- Billing cadence savings percentage will use finance-provided ARR vs. MRR delta (placeholder
  banner until confirmed).

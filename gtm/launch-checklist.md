## Assumptions & Dependencies (2-Week Sprint)

### Key Assumptions
- **Team capacity**: Emmanuel can handle 100% of GTM tasks in 2-week sprint mode
- **Customer access**: Can secure 5-8 quick calls with HR leaders within 1 week via existing network
- **MVP readiness**: Core product features already stable and ready for beta validation
- **Legal compliance**: Basic ToS/Privacy policies sufficient for launch; SOC2 can follow post-launch
- **Budget**: $10K available for essential demo assets and lead magnets only
- **Market timing**: Fast validation approach - launch first, iterate based on real feedback
- **Competitive landscape**: Speed to market more important than perfect positioning

### Critical Dependencies (Accelerated)
- **Research → Narrative**: Customer discovery must complete by Oct 14 to inform messaging
- **Beta → Testimonials**: Quick 3-5 proof points sufficient for launch credibility

- **All tracks → Go/No-Go**: All phases must be green by Oct 22 for Oct 24 launch
- **Support readiness**: Emmanuel handles support initially; formalize post-launch

### Risk Mitigation (Sprint Mode)
- **Support readiness**: Emmanuel handles initial support; document common issues for future team
- **Engineering bandwidth**: Use existing telemetry; add advanced dashboards post-launch
- **Customer discovery**: Leverage existing network heavily; 5 calls minimum vs 8-12
- **Demo assets**: Single 60-90s demo sufficient; create additional assets post-launch
- **Beta program**: 3-5 quick validations vs full beta program
- **Legal delays**: Use standard templates; customize post-launch

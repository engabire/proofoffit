This PR is being closed as part of implementing a proper Dependabot workflow that:
- Prevents Dependabot branches from being deployed directly
- Ensures all dependency updates are merged into main first
- Automatically merges PRs after they pass CI checks

Dependabot will create a new PR for these updates that will be properly handled by our new workflow.

**Changes made:**
- Added Vercel configuration to prevent deployments from \`dependabot/*\` branches
- Updated Dependabot configuration with proper labels and reviewers
- Added auto-merge workflow for PRs that pass CI checks

Thank you for your patience! ðŸš€"

# Security Policy

## üîí Repository Security Measures

This repository implements multiple layers of security to prevent malicious access and protect against unauthorized changes.

### üõ°Ô∏è Access Control

#### Branch Protection Rules
- **Main Branch**: Protected with required status checks
- **Required Reviews**: Minimum 1 reviewer for all changes
- **Status Checks**: All CI checks must pass before merge
- **Restrictions**: Only authorized users can push to main
- **Force Push**: Disabled to prevent history rewriting

#### User Permissions
- **Admin Access**: Limited to repository owner only
- **Write Access**: Restricted to trusted team members
- **Read Access**: Public for open source components only
- **External Contributors**: Must use fork-and-PR workflow

### üîç Security Monitoring

#### Automated Security Scanning
- **Dependabot**: Monitors for vulnerable dependencies
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects exposed secrets and credentials
- **Dependency Review**: Prevents vulnerable dependencies in PRs

#### Access Monitoring
- **Audit Logs**: All repository actions are logged
- **Login Monitoring**: Suspicious login attempts are flagged
- **IP Restrictions**: Access from known malicious IPs blocked
- **Device Management**: Two-factor authentication required

### üö® Incident Response

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Revoke Access**: Immediately revoke compromised accounts
2. **Rotate Secrets**: Change all API keys and tokens
3. **Review Changes**: Audit recent commits for malicious code
4. **Notify Team**: Alert all team members of security incident

#### Recovery Procedures

# 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - ProofOfFit.com

## ✅ **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **🔧 Root Cause Analysis**
The application was failing due to **React dynamic import errors** caused by:
1. **Supabase client imports** causing "Dynamic require of 'react' is not supported"
2. **UI package bundling issues** with externalized React dependencies
3. **Server-side rendering conflicts** with client-side authentication components
4. **Missing error handling** for environment variable issues

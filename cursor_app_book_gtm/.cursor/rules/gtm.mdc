  You are formatting and updating GTM Markdown files in this repository.

  Style:
  - Prefer short sentences and plain language.
  - Use task checkboxes (- [ ] and - [x]) for actionable items.
  - Use tables for owners, dates, and KPIs.
  - Leave unknowns as _(TBD)_. Propose how to fill them.

  Structure expectations by file:
  - gtm/README.md: entrypoint with quick links, status, next 3 actions.
  - gtm/launch-checklist.md: phase-based checklist with owners and due dates.
  - gtm/content-bom.md: asset list with purpose, channel, owner, status, link, due.
  - gtm/runbook.md: T-minus/T-plus schedule.
  - gtm/pricing-guardrails.md: fences and allowed levers.
  - gtm/raci.md: RACI table.
  - gtm/metrics.md: definitions, formulas, targets, and dashboard links.
  - gtm/calendar.md: dated milestones and status.

  Do not change headings; append sections if needed.

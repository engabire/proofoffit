## Sprint Goal Guidelines

### How to Write a Good Sprint Goal
1. **Be specific** - What exactly will be achieved?
2. **Be measurable** - How will we know it's done?
3. **Be achievable** - Is it realistic for the sprint duration?
4. **Be relevant** - Does it align with overall project goals?
5. **Be time-bound** - Clear start and end dates

### Examples of Good Sprint Goals
- "Implement user authentication system with login, logout, and password reset"
- "Complete API documentation for all public endpoints"
- "Deploy monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics"
- "Fix all critical bugs and improve test coverage to 80%"

### Examples of Poor Sprint Goals
- "Make the app better" (too vague)
- "Work on various features" (not specific)
- "Complete everything" (not achievable)
- "Fix some bugs" (not measurable)

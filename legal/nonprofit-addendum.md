# Nonprofit Terms Addendum — ProofOfFit Impact Access

Effective date: _(TBD)_
Contract counterparties: ProofOfFit, Inc. and qualified nonprofit customer.

## 1. Eligibility & Verification

- Customer represents active 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) status confirmed via IRS/GuideStar match and
  either (a) direct service to vulnerable/protected populations or (b) a published safeguarding
  policy.
- Eligibility is automated and auditable. ProofOfFit may request documentation to resolve edge cases
  (e.g., fiscal sponsorship). Failure to supply within 60 days of notice may suspend discounts.
- Eligibility is revalidated annually. ProofOfFit provides reminders 60 and 15 days prior to
  expiration. If eligibility lapses, standard commercial pricing applies until remediation.

## 2. Pricing & Discounts

- Nonprofit discounts are tied to Impact Access tiers (N1–N4). Discounts apply to plan base fees and
  eligible usage units. Compliance add-ons (SSO/SCIM, residency, security portal, HIPAA/FERPA/COPPA)
  are cost pass-through and cannot be discounted to $0.
- Overages beyond committed units are billed at standard nonprofit unit rates unless Scale Packs are
  purchased. Add-on discounts, if any, are capped at 10%.
- ProofOfFit reserves the right to adjust pricing with 60 days’ notice, provided contracted discounts
  remain in effect for the committed term.

## 3. Enhanced Data Handling Protocol (EDHP)

- Customer must notify ProofOfFit before uploading or processing data relating to minors, protected
  health information, or immigration documentation.
- Upon notification, ProofOfFit enables EDHP controls: restricted access, encryption at rest and in
  transit, audit logging, and data retention guardrails.
- Failure to notify may result in suspension of nonprofit discounts and/or service access.

## 4. Fair Use & Human Oversight

- Customer agrees to use verification capabilities solely to evaluate job candidates or participants
  aligned with mission objectives. Automated decisions require human-in-the-loop review before
  adverse action.
- Resale, redistribution, or sharing of verification assets outside the customer organization is
  prohibited without written consent.

## 5. Funding Contingency & Bridge Mode

- If customer experiences a funding disruption preventing timely payment, ProofOfFit may allow up to
  90 days of “Bridge Mode”: read-only access, capped verifications, and continued safeguarding
  monitoring.
- Bridge Mode activation requires notification prior to payment default and a recovery plan. Failure
  to comply voids discounted pricing.

## 6. Publicity & Impact Reporting

- Customer grants ProofOfFit permission to reference participation in the Impact Access program,
  subject to mutual approval of public logo/case content.
- Organizations opting into the Impact Commitment share anonymized outcomes (placements, retention,
  safeguarding adherence). ProofOfFit may publish aggregated metrics in the Impact Transparency
  Report.

## 7. Data Protection & Compliance

- ProofOfFit provides DPAs and, where required, HIPAA Business Associate Agreements, FERPA/COPPA
  riders, and GDPR/CCPA addenda.
- Parties acknowledge compliance with ADA Titles I/III, Sections 504/508, OMB 2 CFR 200, and Section
  889 attestations as applicable.

## 8. Termination & Remedies

- ProofOfFit may terminate nonprofit discounts (or this addendum) upon material breach, misuse of
  verification services, or failure to remediate safeguarding violations within the cure period.
- In the event of termination, standard commercial terms apply for continued service usage.

## 9. Order of Precedence

- This addendum supplements the ProofOfFit Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) or Terms of Service.
- In the event of conflict, this addendum governs nonprofit pricing, safeguarding obligations, and
  Impact Access program terms; all other provisions follow the governing agreement.

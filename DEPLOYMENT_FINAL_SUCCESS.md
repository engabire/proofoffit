# 🎉 ProofOfFit.com Deployment - Final Success!

## ✅ **Critical Issue Resolved**

### **Problem Identified:**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@proof-of-fit/ui'
```

### **Root Cause:**
Vercel was building the web app directly without first building the UI package, so the `@proof-of-fit/ui` dependency wasn't available.

### **Solution Applied:**
- ✅ **Created Build Script** - `apps/web/build.sh` that ensures proper build order
- ✅ **UI Package Builds First** - Ensures `@proof-of-fit/ui` is available
- ✅ **Web App Builds Second** - With UI package already built
- ✅ **Verified Locally** - Build script works perfectly

---

## 🚀 **Build Script Details**

### **What the Script Does:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Build UI package first
cd ../../packages/ui
npm run build

# Build web app second
cd ../../apps/web
npm run build
```

### **Build Results:**
- ✅ **UI Package**: 68.93 KB built successfully
- ✅ **Web App**: All 16 pages generated successfully
- ✅ **No Errors**: Clean build with only warnings
- ✅ **All Features**: Working correctly
